Catch22
=======

Simple ball catching game created in OO VB.NET - Open in Visual Studio 2010/2012

Press F5 to run the game.



Click 'Play' to start the game.

You have to catch the balls falling from the top of the screen in the bucket, while avoiding the bombs.

You have three lives, hitting a bomb will remove one life. When you run out of lives the game is over.

Catching a ball will advance the game one level, on each subsequent level the number of balls and bombs
will increase as will the multiplier applied to your score.



You control the movement of the bucket using the left and right arrow keys.

The balls and bombs will bounce off the sides of the game environment and will randomly change direction.



For every ball you catch you are awarded 200 points.

For every level you advance your multiplier increases by 2, this is applied every time you score by 
catching a ball. However, for every ball you fail to catch, your multiplier is reduced by 2.

For every bomb you avoid you are awarded 10 points, these are not affected by the multiplier.

The game ends when you Catch 22 balls.
